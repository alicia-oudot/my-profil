<h2>🥊SPORT🥊</h2>

<p>

I've done a lot of sports but the one that has made the biggest impression on me is kempo, a Japanese sport that combines kung-fu techniques and Chinese holds. I've been practicing this sport for 6 years and I'd like to start up again in a while.

  <h2>🗺️TRAVEL🗺️</h2>

<p>

  I would like to express my gratitude to my parents, who have given me the opportunity to travel since I was very young. I've had the opportunity to discover a wide range of destinations, including Spain, Portugal, Italy, Corsica, Greece, Russia, Germany, Morocco, the United States and England. 

My passion for travel has had a profound effect on my life, and I hope to continue this wonderful adventure. Exploring new cultures and their unique customs has become my main source of inspiration, strengthening my understanding of the world around us.

Each of these countries has left an indelible mark on my life, offering unique experiences, from the sun-drenched beaches of the Mediterranean to historic cities rich in heritage and architecture.

I remain determined to continue broadening my horizons, increasing my knowledge of the world and creating lasting memories during my future travels. If you have any recommendations or specific destinations to suggest, I'd be delighted to discuss them. 🌍

  <h2>☀️MARSEILLE☀️</h2>

<p>

Marseille embodies the city of my birth, a place where I spent my childhood and which continues to hold a special place in my heart. Even though I moved to Paris to pursue my higher education, Marseille remains an integral part of my identity, a city that is very dear to me.

This Mediterranean city stands out for its warm, welcoming character. Marseille, a city that resonates with me, is characterized by its rich history, cultural heritage, picturesque markets, authentic culinary traditions and spectacular coastal scenery. The diversity of Marseille's neighborhoods, from the Old Port to the Canebière and the Panier, embodies the cultural mosaic of this sunny city.

Marseille remains a unique place, where Mediterranean influences blend harmoniously with traditional values and a friendly atmosphere. Life in Marseille is punctuated by the sun's rays that bathe the city, encounters with warm-hearted locals, and an unshakeable passion for sport, particularly for Olympique de Marseille, which unites the people of Marseille around a common pride.

For me, Marseille transcends the mere status of a city; it embodies a part of my identity and remains a place I carry in my heart with unwavering love.
